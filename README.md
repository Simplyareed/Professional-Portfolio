# Professional-Portfolio

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide: 

- What was your motivation? : My motivation for this project was to build a portfolio that I could be proud of! So that when future job employeer's are directed here they will have access to all of my work as well as see all of my skills including making the portfolio itself! Inside of the portfolio I wanted to include various amounts of items so that a job imployer would be able to use for references, this would include all things like past and future projects. An about me section to describe the person that I am. Any contact information that they may want to use to get in touch with me and so on. With this project I learned how to use many different tools that come along with advanced CSS. There is still more to learn and improve on as I have not mastered it by any means but it is a start and I worked very hard on what I did create no matter the outcome.
